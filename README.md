# springboot-travis-codacy
This repository explains how to integratie **travis**, **codecov** and **codacy** in the github application.

### Application Summary
This is a simple TicketApp application which has bascially a **CRUD** operations using **Swagger**.
I have written unit tests for this application and used **jacoco** for code coverage.

### TravisCI

>Travis CI is a hosted, distributed continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub. Open source projects may be tested at no charge via travis-ci.org. Private projects may be tested at travis-ci.com on a fee basis. -wikipedia

**Prerequisites**
* To start using Travis CI, make sure you have: A GitHub account.
* Owner permissions for a project hosted on GitHub.

### Codecov

>Develop healthier code using Codecov's leading, dedicated code coverage solution.

### Codacy

>Automatically identify issues through static code analysis. Get notified on security issues, code coverage, code duplication and code complexity in every commit and pull request.
>Automatically identify new issues early in the process and prevent your product from being affected. Keep your technical debt under control and focus your development time on what matters.
